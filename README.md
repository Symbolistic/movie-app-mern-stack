# Favorite Movies App
This app utilizes TMDb API to get the latest movies and users can favorite & keep track of the movies, it has a full login system along with options to favorite movies and see the latest movies informaton. I used redux to pass around user data on this app. This is hosted on Heroku so the inital load might be a bit slow.
